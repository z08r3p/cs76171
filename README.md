SECTION A
1.       (a)   Use the Euclidean algorithm to ﬁnd d   =   (936,   2200).       [7 marks]
(b)   Use   your   solution   to   part   (a) to   ﬁndh,   k   ∈ Z   satisfying
d   = 936h   + 2200k.           [10 marks]
(c)   When   we   write   a   natural   number   n   in   base-6, we   write   n   as   a   string nk   . . .   n0   of digits ni    ∈   {0, 1, 2,   3,   4, 5} uniquely determined so that
n = nk   6k    + nk   -16k-1   + . .   . +   n1   6 +   n0   .  
Show   that   n   is   divisible   by   5 if   and   only   if 
5   j   nk   + nk   -1   + . .   .   +   n1   +   n0   .          [5 marks]
2.   In   this   question, you   must   justify   all   of   your   assertions, but   you   may   refer to   results   from   the   lecture   notes   without   proof.
(a)   Find   all   solutions   to   the   linear   congruence
14x 三 21   (mod   63)
by   reducing   it   to   a   linear   congruence   with   a   unique   solution   (modulo m).      [7 marks]
(b)   Find   all   solutions   to   the   following   system   of   congruences.2x 三 3   (mod   5)         3x 三 5   (mod   7)         5x 三 7   (mod   11)       [12 marks]
(c)   Show   that   the   congruence
x2 三 3   (mod   5005)
has   no   solutions.          [4 marks]
3.   In   this   question, you   may   use   any   results   from   the   lecture   notes   without proof.
(a)   Find   the   remainder   when   we   divide   3621   by   8. [9 marks] 
(b)   Find   the   exponent   of   3 in   the   prime   factorisation   of   2024!.        [6 marks]
SECTION B 
Throughout, you   must   justify   all   of   your   answers.
4.         (a)      (代 写NUMBER THEORY (MA3Z7)Python
代做程序编程语言i)   Give   an   example   of   an   arithmetic   function   that   is   not multiplicative. [3 marks] (ii)   Give   an   example   of   an   arithmetic   function   that   is   multiplicative 
but   not   completely   multiplicative.   You   need   not   prove   that   your function   is   multiplicative   if   this   was   established   in   lectures.           [3 marks]
(iii)   Find   the   sum   of   the   divisors   of   385.   You   may   assume   any formula   given   in   lectures. [4 marks] (b)   Express   the   generating   function   of   the   divisor   function   in   terms   of   the 
Riemann   zeta   function.   You   may   use   any   results   from   the   lecture notes   as   long   as   you   state   them   precisely.       [9 marks]
(c)   Let   λ(n) =   (—1)k      where   k   is   the   total   number   of   prime   factors   of   n (so   λ(12)   =   λ(2 · 2 · 3)   =   (—1)3    =   —1).
(i)   Show   that   the   generating   function   of   λ(n) is   ζ(2s)ζ(s)—1   .   You may   assume   that   λ(n) is   completely   multiplicative.          [7 marks]
(ii)   Show   that
You may use the value ζ(4) = 90/π4. You may assume any results from the notes without proof.       [14 marks]
5.         (a)   State   and   prove   the   fundamental   property   of   the   Von   Mangoldt function   Λ(n).        [11 marks]
(b)   Express   the   generating   function   of   σ(n) in   terms   of   the   Riemann   zeta function.   You   may   use   any   results   from   the   lecture   notes   as   long   as you   state   them   precisely.        [9 marks]
(c)   Show that

You   may   use   any   results   from   the   lecture   notes   without   proof.       [20 marks]
